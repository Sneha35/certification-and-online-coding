# Pro1
 Python program to read a number and print the pattern.
 # Pro2
A simple solution is simply multiply and count trailing 0s in product. This solution may cause integer overflow. A better solution is based on the fact that zeros are formed by a combination of 2 and 5. Hence the number of zeros will depend on the number of pairs of 2’s and 5’s that can be formed.
